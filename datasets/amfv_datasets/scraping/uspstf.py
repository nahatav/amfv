"""Scrape USPSTF recommendation statements into normalized markdown documents.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force publishes final recommendation
statements for clinical preventive services, each carrying a letter grade (A,
B, C, D, or I) that reflects the certainty and magnitude of net benefit.

Discovery works around a quirk of the published-recommendations listing: it
reports a total in a "Hits: N" counter but renders only the first 20 rows,
with no working pager or page-size parameter. The same view filtered by one
of its twelve topic categories does return that category's full set, so
discovery walks all twelve up front and deduplicates by slug. A
recommendation that belongs to several categories is therefore listed
several times and scraped once. The categories are walked eagerly rather
than one per listing page because a category can contribute nothing new,
and the shared listing loop reads an empty page as the end of the source,
which would silently drop every later category.

Only recommendations the listing marks Published are kept. The listing is
requested with `topic_status=P`, but that filter stops being honoured once a
category filter is applied, so rows marked Inactive or Referred (guidance
USPSTF has retired or handed to another body, some dating to 1996) come back
too and are dropped here. Retired guidance in a verification corpus is worse
than a smaller corpus: it produces confident, wrong verdicts.

Content is assembled from the recommendation's own outline: the
population/recommendation/grade summary table, then each content panel.
Panels that are boilerplate identical across every recommendation (the
preamble or mission statement) or purely administrative (task force
membership, the copyright notice) are skipped, since 100+ verbatim copies of
the same text are noise in a corpus.

Licensing: USPSTF recommendations are not public domain despite being
federal work. AHRQ's copyright notice
(https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation-topics/copyright-notice)
permits reproduction and redistribution "provided that it is reproduced
without any changes to the work or portions thereof, except as permitted as
fair use", prohibits redistribution for a fee or incorporation into a
profit-making venture without written permission, and asks that the USPSTF
web page be cited when parts are quoted. Every document carries `LICENSE`,
`LICENSE_URL`, and `ATTRIBUTION` in its metadata so this travels downstream.
The no-changes term deserves attention before this corpus feeds claim
decomposition or model training, both of which are derivative uses; that
call belongs to whoever builds those pipelines, not to this scraper.

Documents are large: live samples run 15,000-95,000 characters, since a
recommendation statement bundles its rationale, evidence review, and
references.
